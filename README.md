# RADseq_Bioinformatics2023
This project focuses on the divergence between populations of the mimic poison frog _Ranitomeya imitator_ across a transition zone where there is a transition from a yellow striped morph to an orange banded morph of _R. imitator_. The data is collected from 5 populations within the transition zone (2 banded, 1 striped, and 1 intermediate morph) and an allopatric striped population. This project aims to quantify the amount of divergence and gene flow using population genomics methods as well as the directionality of gene flow.
